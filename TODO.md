* LaTeX labels
  * https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-demos-web/blob/master/input-tex2svg.html.md

  * Gluon (same as photon but with cycloid curve)
  * Curved lines/loops
* Vertex styles
  * Blob
  * Insertion
* Momentum indicators
* Display edits in progress (e.g. greyed out half-specified edges)
